To install put the sites-available/tanks file in /etc/nginx/sites-available. This should then be symlinked into /sites-enabled/, this can be done by:

```bash
# copy the file
sudo cp sites-available/tanks /etc/nginx/sites-available
# go to nginx's settings directory
cd /etc/nginx/sites-available
# create symlink to sites-enabled
sudo ln -s tanks ../sites-enabled
```
